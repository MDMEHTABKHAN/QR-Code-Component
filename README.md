# QR-Code-Component
This project involves creating a QR code component that encourages users to improve their front-end development skills.
</br>
As part of this project, a QR code component that motivates users to advance their front-end coding abilities will be created. JavaScript is used exclusively for styling the component; CSS styles are used dynamically to improve the visual display. The QR code directs viewers to an online site where they can advance their knowledge of coding. With
a compelling call to action, the design is responsive, minimalist, and centered on the page. This project is an excellent practice for front-end programming since it shows off the developer's ability to manipulate and style the DOM using JavaScript.
